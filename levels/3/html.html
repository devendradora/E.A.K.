    Now that you've got the hang of making stuff bigger, let's try the other way. If
    you get rid of the writing in the cliff, it'll get smaller. Then, you'll be able to
    jump up to the kitten!

  I'm a cliff. Did you know that the internet has cliffs? It doesn't really -
  not properly. I'm the only one, I think. It's kind of lonely being the only
  cliff on the web. I get on okay though. The ledges keep me company. Floor
  is pretty annoying though. He's pretty self-obsessed.
