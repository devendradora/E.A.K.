        Now that you've got the hang of making stuff bigger, let's try the other way. If
        you get rid of the writing in the cliff, it'll get smaller. Then, you'll be able to
        jump up to the kitten!

      I'm a cliff. Did you know that the internet has cliffs? It doesn't really -
      not properly. I'm the only one, I think. It's kind of lonely being the only
      cliff on the web. I get on okay though. The ledges keep me company. Floor
      is pretty annoying though. He's pretty self-obsessed.
