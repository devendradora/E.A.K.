HTML/CSS Game
=============

A currently unnamed platform game, where players have to modify the source
code of the level in order to complete it.

The game is currently under development, and is far from done. There's a demo
on [my website](http://j.dytry.ch/stuff/html-css-game/).
Let me know what you think!

I'd appreciate any help I can get with this. Notably, I'd like someone to help
me out with the visual design, and someone to help me design levels. Music and
a proper story for the game are in the works. If you have any ideas for a title,
that would be great too!
